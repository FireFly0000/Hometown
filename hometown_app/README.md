Title: Hometown 


Hometown aims to empower small businesses by pooling together data and organizing campaigns suited towards local patrons. By doing so, we prevent smaller businesses from being overshadowed by big corporations. Hometown will be a mobile app where store owners have a simple interface to send out reminders and campaigns to loyal customers. The significance of this project lies in the ability of it being able to give back power to smaller businesses that do not have access to the tech and data which larger corporations are utilizing.

Team Members: Bang Do, Nicholas Chang, Amy Zheng, Tann Nguyen, Athan Chu
